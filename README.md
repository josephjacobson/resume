# Quotes
Some things said about me from collegues and reports.

He prioritized identifying customer impact and restoring service as quickly as possible. He proactively identified hot spots and recurring issues with reliability and data loss for the software owners to address. He earned a high degree of trust and recognition for his expertise and approach. Finally, he adapted to the complexity of new microservices, making him and his team effective at debugging distributed problems. His colleagues appreciated his direction and advice during active incidents and postmortems.

> Joe is a great resource as a manager. He knows quite a bit about the ins and outs of Ops infrastructure and processes. He's a good listener, provides great constructive feedback and is also quite open to ideas from his reports (myself included).

> Joe has been a fantastic manager, he is always providing consistent communication, praise, feedback and open communication. I really appreciate how straight-forward Joe is when communicating to the team and to me individually.

He strikes a balance between providing us with the necessary autonomy to execute our tasks effectively and remaining aware of all ongoing developments within the team.

He consistently demonstrates that he is quick to hone in on the key factors for a given situation, keeps discussions focused on those factors to prevent loss of focus, and follows up to ensure completion.
